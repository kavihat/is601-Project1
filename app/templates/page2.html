           Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. It provides a set of Platform as a Service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer, enabling the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public or private cloud.

The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.</p>
            <h2>Containers</h2>
<p>Containers are standardized executable components combining application source code with the OS libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment, also called the host environment. This simplifies delivery of distributed applications, making containers popular for cloud-native development and hybrid multi-cloud environments.

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files. They can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Container technology offers all the functionality and benefits of VMs — including application isolation, cost-effective scalability, and disposability — plus other advantages, such as lighter weight, greater resource efficiency, and improved developer productivity (by being faster and easier to deploy, provision and restart).
</p>
            <h2>Components</h2>

The Docker software as a service offering includes these components.
  <ol>
         <li>Software</li>
      <ul><li>The Docker daemon, called dockerd, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects. It runs as a background service on the host, managing the building, running and distribution of Docker containers.</li> </ul>
      <ul><li>The Docker client program, called docker, provides a command-line interface that allows users to interact with Docker daemons. These requests are sent via the Docker Engine API. </ul></li>
      <li>Objects</br> Docker objects are various entities used to assemble an application in Docker. This includes images, containers, and services.</li>
            <ul><li>Docker container: A standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications. These are the live, running instances of Docker images.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Docker image: A read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Docker service: Allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. A set of cooperating daemons can communicate through the Docker API.</li></ul>
    <li>Registries</br>  A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries to download ("pull") images for use or upload ("push") images that they have built. Registries can be public or private. Two main public registries are Docker Hub and Docker Cloud. Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images. Docker registries also allow the creation of notifications based on events.</li>
    <li>Docker Compose </br>  Docker Compose allows users to build an application out of processes in multiple containers that all reside on the same host. It consolidates the configuration of all the services that are included in the application, and can deploy and run their containers in a single command.</li>
        </ol>
