Python is a high-level multi-paradigm programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity, with the aim of helping programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects. It features a comprehensive standard library, due to which Python has been a “batteries included” language.
</p>
<p>
Today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages, according to multiple organizations that track programming language utilization for personal, scientific, and enterprise use.
</p>
<h2>Origins and History</h2>
<p>
Python was conceived in the 1980’s by Guido Van Rossum, who until recently, served as Python’s lead developer, chief decision maker, and Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). The name is a tribute to the British comedy group, Monty Python.
</p>
<p>
Python 2 was released in 2000, and Python 3 in 2008. Python versions before Python 3.0.0 versions have been sunset as of 2020. The latest stable release is Python 3.10.
</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
The core design philosophy of the Python programming language is summarized as a set of 19 principles, called the Zen of Python, which are listed as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
<li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
<li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
<li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
<li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
<li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
<li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
<li>There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.</li>
<li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
<li>Now is better than never.</li>
<li>Although never is often better than right now.</li>
<li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
<li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
<li>Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, allowing object-oriented and structured programming, with additional support for functional programming constructs and metaprogramming.
</p>
<p>
Python is a dynamically-typed language. It has typed objects, but untyped variable names, and uses duck typing. It also features garbage collection, utilizing a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
